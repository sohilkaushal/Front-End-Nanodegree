# Feed Reader Testing Project

### Overview of the project

* In this project we are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite.
* In this many new tests suits were also build in.

### Requirements
* Web Browser of your choice.
* IDE of your choice to gothrough the code if you like.

### How to operate the given application

* Download the Feed Reader Testing.zip file.
* Unzip the file and open the folder, now locate the index.html file.
* Open index.html file in any browser of your choice.
* Wait for a moment to complete the processing to complete.
* In my case the wating period was around 4-5 seconds.

* Stack Overflow
* Random Google Searches
* Some Random Projects on github that I consulted from time to time.
